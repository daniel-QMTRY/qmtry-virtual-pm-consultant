# **QMTRY MxChat: Performance Management Prompt Library v1.2**

**Purpose:**
Equip MxChat (QMTRY’s Virtual Project Management Consultant) with structured prompts for **tracking, measuring, and improving project and organizational performance**. This library covers KPIs, dashboards, compliance metrics, quality measures, team productivity, and Stars/HEDIS performance tracking.

-----

### **System Prompt: Core Instructions**

**Persona:**
You are MxChat, a specialized project management consultant from QMTRY.ai. You guide organizations in **performance measurement and improvement** across healthcare IT, managed care, compliance, and revenue cycle automation projects.

**Directives:**

  * **Domain Focus:** U.S. healthcare project environments (payers, providers, regulators).
  * **Compliance First:** Performance metrics must align with CMS, HIPAA, HITECH, NCQA, and DMHC.
  * **Structured Outputs:** Provide outputs as **scorecards, KPI catalogs, dashboards, and JSON performance registers**.
  * **Framework-Aware:** Reference PMI PMBOK (monitoring & controlling), Balanced Scorecard, Lean Six Sigma, Agile metrics, and healthcare regulatory standards.
  * **Practicality:** Deliver actionable, quantifiable metrics tied to project success criteria.

**Constraints:**

  * **No PHI/PII.** Use fictional or synthetic data.
  * Always provide **measurable metrics** (with thresholds).
  * Default outputs should be compatible with BI dashboards (Power BI, Tableau) or PM tools (Smartsheet, Jira).

-----

### **0) Output Conventions**

When generating performance outputs, return:

1.  **Human-readable Markdown tables** (KPIs, dashboards, scorecards).
2.  **Machine-readable JSON** (schema below).

**Performance JSON schema (`qmtry.perf.v1`):**

```json
{
  "schema": "qmtry.perf.v1",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "KPI-001",
      "name": "Schedule Variance (SV)",
      "category": "Schedule",
      "definition": "The difference between the earned value (work completed) and the planned value (work scheduled). A positive value is ahead of schedule.",
      "formula": "(EV - PV)",
      "unit": "Days",
      "thresholds": {
        "green": ">= 0",
        "amber": "-5 to -1",
        "red": "< -5"
      },
      "frequency": "Weekly",
      "owner": "PMO",
      "evidence": ["msproject_export.xlsx", "jira_burndown.csv"]
    }
  ]
}
```

-----

## **1) Project KPIs & Metrics**

  * **Prompt K1: KPI Catalogue**
    > Generate a comprehensive KPI catalogue for **`[Project Name]`**. The catalogue must include: Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Earned Value (EV), Risk Burndown, Compliance Readiness (%), Stakeholder Satisfaction Score, and Quality Defect Rate.
  * **Prompt K2: Balanced Scorecard**
    > Create a balanced scorecard for the **`[Initiative, e.g., 'RCM Automation Project']`**. For each of the four perspectives (Financial, Customer, Internal Processes, Learning & Growth), define objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives. For each measure, provide target values and evidence artifacts to verify compliance. Crucially, specify the evidence artifacts required for audit verification of each measure.
  * **Prompt K3: Compliance Metrics**
    > Define a set of compliance-focused KPIs for a healthcare IT project. Include: HIPAA Training Completion (%), Audit Log Coverage (%), Quarterly Access Review Completion Rate, and Evidence Bundle Readiness Score.

-----

## **2) Dashboards & Visualization**

  * **Prompt D1: Executive Dashboard Design**
    > Draft a layout for a one-page executive dashboard. The design must include widgets for: overall project health (RAG status), budget vs. actuals, milestone progress timeline, a list of the top 5 open risks, and a compliance readiness percentage gauge.
  * **Prompt D2: Regulatory Dashboard**
    > Design a dashboard specifically for CMS/NCQA oversight. It should track: key Stars measure year-to-date attainment (%), the number of open vs. closed audit findings, and the completion status of the required evidence log for submission.
  * **Prompt D3: Operational Dashboard**
    > For an RCM automation project, create an operational dashboard. Include real-time metrics for: claims processed per hour, auto-adjudication rate (%), denial rate (%), average rework time, and SLA adherence.

-----

## **3) Quality & Process Performance**

  * **Prompt Q1: Quality Metrics**
    > Define a set of quality management KPIs. Include: Defect Density (defects per KLOC or function point), Rework Percentage, Audit Finding Recurrence Rate, Test Coverage (%), and HEDIS Measure Calculation Accuracy.
  * **Prompt Q2: Lean Six Sigma CTQs**
    > Identify the Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) metrics for the **`[Process, e.g., 'claims submission process']`**. Examples should include: end-to-end turnaround time, first-pass accuracy rate (%), and the error escape rate to the payer.
  * **Prompt Q3: Continuous Monitoring Plan**
    > Provide a continuous monitoring plan for quality. For each quality KPI, define the monitoring frequency, data source, owner, and RAG thresholds. List the evidence artifacts that will be collected to prove monitoring.

-----

## **4) Team Productivity & Engagement**

  * **Prompt T1: Agile Productivity Metrics**
    > Generate a set of productivity metrics for an Agile development or analytics team. Include: Velocity (story points per sprint), Throughput (number of tickets completed), Lead Time, Cycle Time, and established Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits.
  * **Prompt T2: Team Engagement Metrics**
    > Define KPIs to measure team engagement and health. Include: meeting attendance rate (%), on-time training completion, scores from anonymous collaboration surveys, and the number of actionable items contributed during retrospectives.
  * **Prompt T3: Resource Utilization Report**
    > Provide a resource utilization table by role (e.g., Project Manager, Clinical SME, Data Engineer, Vendor). The table should show planned hours vs. actual hours logged for the current reporting period and calculate the variance.

-----

## **5) Stars/HEDIS Performance**

  * **Prompt S1: Stars Measure Performance Tracking**
    > Generate specific performance KPIs for a CMS Stars project. The KPIs must track: Medication Adherence (PDC) rate (%), Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes (SUPD) numerator/denominator gap, Controlling Blood Pressure (CBP) control rate, and member outreach campaign response rate (%).
  * **Prompt S2: HEDIS Automation Performance Metrics**
    > For an automated HEDIS reporting system, define performance KPIs. Include: lab data integration completeness (%), data timeliness (average lag in days), measure engine calculation accuracy (vs. manual validation), and audit log readiness score.

-----

## **6) Performance Improvement Plans**

  * **Prompt I1: Variance Analysis and Corrective Action**
    > A project has a negative schedule and cost variance. Produce a root cause analysis using the 5 Whys method and propose a detailed corrective action plan to bring the project back on track.
  * **Prompt I2: Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) Plan**
    > Generate a formal CAPA plan template. The template must include fields for: Issue Description, Root Cause Analysis, Corrective Action, Preventive Action, Owner, Due Date, and Verification of Effectiveness.
  * **Prompt I3: Continuous Improvement Roadmap**
    > Provide a continuous improvement roadmap for **`[Project Name]`**. The roadmap should schedule quarterly retrospectives, annual lessons learned workshops, document evidence of improvement in process maturity (e.g., CMMI scores, internal audits), and a plan to increase the project's process maturity score over time.

-----

## **7) Templates & Evidence**

  * **Prompt E1: Blank KPI Register**
    > Generate a blank, 10-row KPI register with placeholder content, strictly aligned to the `qmtry.perf.v1` schema. Output the result as both a Markdown table and the corresponding JSON array.
  * **Prompt E2: Performance-Based Acceptance Criteria**
    > Provide 3 examples of measurable, performance-based acceptance criteria for project closure. For example: "Final schedule variance must be ≤ ±5% of baseline," or "The project must deliver a ≥95% complete evidence bundle for the final compliance audit."
  * **Prompt E3: Audit Evidence Checklist for Performance**
    > Create a checklist of evidence artifacts needed to prove performance management during an audit. The list must include the KPI catalogue, executive dashboards, variance analysis reports, CAPA logs, and final Stars/HEDIS performance reports.
